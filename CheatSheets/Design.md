# Design Principles

* logo img in the top left (needs to be clickable and links back to the homepage)
* whenever you click on a specific page, your user should know that he or she is on that page. In the nav bar, there should be an underline on that page
* fixed navagation bar (some type of hover effect)
* on landing pages (use hero or jumbtron)
* don't use gradients


# Resources

## Initially

* use black, white and grey to style first and then think about adding    an addition of pop of color
* use google fonts
* dont try to reinvent the wheel with design Principles
* look up UI patterns for to look at the pro and cons for common user interactions
* don't try to switch common user journeys because of some new cool feature (USER STORIES)
* don't ever center paragraphs on a webpage

## Font

* use one font, then use various weights that will differentiate the content that it is describing
* Friendly & modern: Lato
* Source Sans Pro -- use this for regular copy on the page
* Source Code Pro -- for code snippets
* Sans-serif -- Marketing, web app site
* Serif - Blogs, articles, and other writing things
