# Design Principles

* logo img in the top left (needs to be clickable and links back to the homepage)
* whenever you click on a specific page, your user should know that he or she is on that page. In the nav bar, there should be an underline on that page
* fixed navagation bar (some type of hover effect)
* on landing pages (use hero or jumbtron)
  + sometimes with the hero img there can be text that lets the user know the mission of the company... in white text.
* don't use gradients
* don't make users think (try the down the hall method and let someone try to use your website)
